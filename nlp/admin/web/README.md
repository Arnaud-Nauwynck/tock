Run these npm commands in order to setup and launch [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) :

```
npm install
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng serve
```

Of course you need also to start the [NLP Admin server](https://github.com/theopenconversationkit/tock/blob/master/.idea/runConfigurations/Admin.xml).
