You can test a model via the Tock NLP API.

Please consult the documentation [/api](../../api/).

If you want to test the API, run the [docker images](https://github.com/theopenconversationkit/tock-docker)
and open the url [http://localhost/doc/index.html](http://localhost/doc/index.html)   

Also, Administration API (in order to manage the models) is documented: [/api/admin](../../api/admin.html) 

If you want to test the Admin API, run the [docker images](https://github.com/theopenconversationkit/tock-docker)
and open the url [http://localhost/doc/admin.html](http://localhost/doc/admin.html)
